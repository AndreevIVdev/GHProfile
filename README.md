# GHProfile

GHProfile is a simple single view application for iPhone. 
It allows to get information about GitHub users and their accounts, add them to favorites, view their profiles in the Internet, show followers.
GHProfile uses GitHub api. You need stable internet connection for full functionallity. 

You can find in the code such technologies and methods like:
1) Json parsing, decoding.
2) Image downloading and caching.
3) UICollectionViewDiffableDataSource and NSDiffableDataSourceSnapshot usage, animating search in UICollectionView.
4) Custom animating tableview elements movement.

Application is based at MVCN architecture.

This is of course only study project, that represents my skills and knowledges atm.
